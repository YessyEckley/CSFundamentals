         * Look and Say
         * 
         * Implement a function that outputs the Look and Say sequence:
         *      1
         *      11
         *      21
         *      1211
         *      111221
         *      312211
         *      13112221
         *      1113213211
         *      31131211131221
         *      13211311123113112211
         * Solution
         *      This problem is fairly straightforward and should not take a long time to solve. 
         *      However, be sure you do proper error checking of the input first! (Empty and invalid inputs should be taken into account). 
         *      Additionally, you can ask yourself:
         *          -> How does the ouput length scale?
         *          -> What is the max single digit that can exist in the output?
         *          -> What is the only starting sequence that never grows in length?
