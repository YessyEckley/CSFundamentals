         * Exercise 1
         * In an alien language, surprisingly they also use the english lower case letters, but possibly in a different order.
         * The order of the alphabet is some permutation of lowercase letters
         * 
         * Given a sequence of words written in the alien language, and the order of the alphabet, 
         * return true if and only if the given words are sorter lexicographicaly in this alien language
         *
